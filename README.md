# LearningMachine
This is a repo for all work on our Machine Learning project work on the [Kaggle Forest Cover Prediction Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction).
A lot of inspiration on modeling choices have come from kernels that are posted, but it appears that the most useful ones have either been taken down or been entirely changed since we first accessed them, so there is no longer a relevant link to provide to them.

Our [write-up](/DSGA1003_Forest_Cover_Classification.pdf/) and [poster](/predicting-forest-cover.pdf/) have also been posted if you are looking for more guidance on our decisions, but you should find that most notebooks are fairly well documented to provide insight into our methods.

In the meantime enjoy this pair-wise scatter matrix for the distribution of continuous features.
